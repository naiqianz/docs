[OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/) is an open source observability framework hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It is a merger of OpenCensus and OpenTracing projects.

OpenTelemetry aims to provide a single standard across all types of observability signals such as [OpenTemetry logs](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/logs.html), [distributed tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html), and [metrics](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/metrics.html).

OpenTelemetry specifies how to collect and send telemetry data to backend platforms. With OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your application once and then add or change vendors without changing the instrumentation.
