[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/collector.html) is an agent that pulls telemetry data from systems you want to monitor and export the collected data to an [OpenTelemetry backend](https://uptrace.dev/blog/opentelemetry-backend.html).

Otel Collector provides powerful data processing capabilities, allowing you to perform aggregation, filtering, sampling, and enrichment of telemetry data. You can transform and reshape the data to fit your specific monitoring and analysis requirements before sending it to the backend systems.
