[OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/) is an open-source observability framework that aims to standardize and simplify the collection, processing, and export of telemetry data from applications and systems.

OpenTelemetry supports multiple programming languages and platforms, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and environments.

OpenTelemetry enables developers to instrument their code and collect telemetry data, which can then be exported to various [OpenTelemetry backends](https://uptrace.dev/blog/opentelemetry-backend.html) or observability platforms for analysis and visualization.
