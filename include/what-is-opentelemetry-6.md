[OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/) is an open source observability framework that helps developers instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data from software applications.

OpenTelemetry provides a unified set of APIs, libraries, and instrumentation tools for capturing and transmitting [traces](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html), [metrics](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/metrics.html), and [logs](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/logs.html) to effectively monitor and troubleshoot distributed systems.

The primary goal of OpenTelemetry is to provide a standardized and vendor-agnostic approach to instrumenting applications for observability. It aims to simplify the process of collecting telemetry data by providing a single, consistent API and providing integration with various [OpenTelemetry backends](https://uptrace.dev/blog/opentelemetry-backend.html).
