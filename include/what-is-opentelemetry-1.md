[OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/) is an open source and vendor-neutral API for [OpenTelemetry tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html), [logs](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/logs.html), and [metrics](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/metrics.html).

OpenTelemetry provides a set of APIs, libraries, and instrumentation tools to instrument applications and collect data about their behavior and performance.

The goal of OpenTelemetry is to provide a standardized and vendor agnostic way to instrument applications for observability, for example, many [open source tracing tools](https://uptrace.dev/blog/distributed-tracing-tools.html) already support OpenTelemetry.
