[OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/) is an open source observability framework for [OpenTelemetry tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html), [logs](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/logs.html), and [metrics](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/metrics.html).

OpenTelemetry allows developers to collect and export telemetry data in a vendor-agnostic manner. With OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your application once and then add or change vendors without changing the instrumentation, for example, here is a list of popular [DataDog competitors](https://uptrace.dev/blog/datadog-competitors.html) that support OpenTelemetry.

OpenTelemetry is available for most programming languages and provides interoperability across different languages and environments.
