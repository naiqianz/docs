You can deploy [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/collector.html) as an agent that runs on individual hosts, where it periodically collects and forwards diagnostic information about the running system to various [distributed tracing tools](https://uptrace.dev/blog/distributed-tracing-tools.html).

OpenTelemetry Collector provides powerful data processing capabilities. It can aggregate, filter, transform, and enrich telemetry data as it flows through the system.
