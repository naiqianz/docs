[OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/) is a vendor-neutral standard on how to collect telemetry data for applications and their supporting infrastructures. OpenTelemetry was created by merging OpenCensus and OpenTracing projects.

OpenTelemetry aims to standardize how you collect and send telemetry data to backend platforms: [distributed tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html), [logs](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/logs.html), and [OpenTelemetry metrics](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/metrics.html).

By using OpenTelemetry, developers gain valuable insight into the performance, behavior and dependencies of their applications, enabling them to optimize and troubleshoot their systems more effectively.
