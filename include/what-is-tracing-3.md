[OpenTelemetry tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html) allows to observe requests as they propagate through distributed systems, especially those built using a microservices architecture.

Tracing provides insights into your app performance along with any errors and logs. You immediately see what conditions cause errors and how particular error affects app performance.
