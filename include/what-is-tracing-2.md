[OpenTelemetry tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html) allows to precisely pinpoint the problem in complex systems, especially those built using a microservices architecture.

Tracing allows to follow requests as they travel through distributed systems. You get a full context of what is different, what is broken, and which logs & errors are relevant.
