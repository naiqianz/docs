Uptrace comes with an intuitive query builder, rich dashboards, alerting rules with notifications, and integrations for most languages and frameworks.

Uptrace can process billions of spans and metrics on a single server and allows you to monitor your applications at 10x lower cost.

In just a few minutes, you can try Uptrace by visiting the [cloud demo](https://app.uptrace.dev/play) (no login required) or running it locally with [Docker](https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace/tree/master/example/docker).
